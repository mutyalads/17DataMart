Bindows:

* Launch and debug Bindows AJAX applications directly from within IntelliJ IDEA
* The debugging features enable you to send messages to a console window inside IntelliJ IDEA from your code
* This works for both Internet Explorer and Firefox
* You can also send JavaScript code to be evaluated inside any running browser instance from IntelliJ IDEA
* This enables you to remote control the browser, check the values of variables and even rewrite whole methods during runtime
* Check our web site for more information on how to use these features
* We also have an xml schema that will give you code completion of Bindows classes in xml
* The schema is included in the plugin and automatically installed
* You also have the ability to add multiple Bindows distributions and quickly switch between them
