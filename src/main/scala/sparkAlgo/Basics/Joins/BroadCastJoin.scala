/**
  * In Spark broadcast variables are shared among executors using the Torrent protocol.
  *   The Torrent protocol is a Peer-to-Peer protocol which is know to perform very well for distributing data sets across multiple peers.
  *   The advantage of the Torrent protocol is that peers share blocks of a file among each other not relying on a central entity holding all the blocks.
