Stochastic Process:

    Stochastic or random process is a mathematical object
    defined as collection of random variables. New stochastic process are
        * Poisson process
        * Winener process (Brownian motion process)

    *  Categories:
        ramdom walks
        martinagales
        Markov Process
        Levy Processes
        Gaussian Processes
        random fileds
        renewal process
        branching process

    * Study of stochastic process requires
        probablitity
        calculus
        linear algebra
        set theory
        topology
        mathematical analysis
            real analysis
            measure theory
            fourier theory
            functional analysis
    * Classifications:
        state space
        index set
        dependencies among random variables
        cardinality between index and state space
        continuous variable vs discontinuous
